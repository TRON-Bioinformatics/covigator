                    TRON is an independent biopharmaceutical non-profit translational research organization pursuing 
                    new diagnostics and drugs for the treatment of cancer and other diseases with high medical need. 
                    We focus our transdisciplinary competencies in genomics and immunology to 
                    1) develop novel platforms for the identification and validation of “omics”-based biomarkers
                    and 2) for harnessing and modulating immune system components, for use in personalized therapies.
                    Partnering with academia and industry, TRON executes research at the leading edge to support 
                    innovative drug design for human health.
